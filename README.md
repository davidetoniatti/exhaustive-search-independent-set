# Maximum Independent Set Solver

This repository provides implementations of algorithms to find an **Independent Set** in a graph.  
An **Independent Set** is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent. The problem of finding the **Maximum Independent Set (MIS)** is NP-hard, so this project implements both **exact** and **approximate** methods.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

```
src/
â”‚â”€â”€ exaustive_search_is.py   # Branch-and-Bound exhaustive search algorithm
â”‚â”€â”€ greedy_is.py             # Greedy heuristic algorithm
â”‚â”€â”€ utils.py                 # Utility functions (graph I/O, helpers)
```

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Exact approach (Branch-and-Bound):**
  - Implemented in `exaustive_search_is.py`.
  - Tries all possibilities with pruning to find the maximum independent set.

- **Greedy heuristic:**
  - Implemented in `greedy_is.py`.
  - Iteratively selects the node with the smallest degree and removes its neighbors.
  - Fast, but not guaranteed to be optimal.

- **Utility functions (`utils.py`):**
  - Graph generation from file or randomly.
  - Independent set verification.
  - Write results to file.
  - Helper to get the node with minimum degree.

## ðŸ“– Usage

### 1. Prepare Input Graph
Graphs are read from an input file in the following format:

```
n m
u1 v1
u2 v2
...
um vm
```

Where:
- `n` = number of nodes  
- `m` = number of edges  
- Each of the next `m` lines represents an undirected edge `(u, v)`.

You can also generate a random graph with `random_graph_generator(n, p)` from `utils.py`.  
This will create a file called `input.txt`.

### 2. Run the Algorithms

**Exhaustive Search (Branch-and-Bound):**
```bash
python3 src/exaustive_search_is.py input.txt
```

**Greedy Heuristic:**
```bash
python3 src/greedy_is.py input.txt
```

### 3. Output
Both algorithms write their results to `output.txt` in the format:

```
k
v1
v2
...
vk
```

Where `k` is the size of the independent set, followed by the list of nodes.

## ðŸ›  Dependencies
- Python 3.7+
- [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) for graph operations.

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install networkx
```

## ðŸ“Š Example

**Input (`input.txt`):**
```
4 3
0 1
1 2
2 3
```

**Run greedy:**
```bash
python3 src/greedy_is.py input.txt
```

**Output (`output.txt`):**
```
2
0
2
```

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- The exhaustive algorithm guarantees the maximum independent set but is exponential in complexity â€” only feasible for small graphs.
- The greedy algorithm runs fast and works on larger graphs, but the result is not always optimal.
